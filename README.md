Simulation Software For Oliver's Machine

This [Processing ](https://processing.org) application simulates Oliver's machine.

To run it, load it into Processing 3, then click the "play" arrow in the Processing IDE.

A window will appear with the simulation running.

A key stroke or mouse click will pause/restart the simulation.

Simulation parameters that can be set by the user are:
* Small disk sizes
* distance between the small disks (center to center)
* big wheel size
* wheel speeds
* pen holder arm lengths
* pen color
* simulation speed

These are all set in the "Config" tab of the IDE.

There should be no need to make changes in any other tab.

A [screencast](https://youtu.be/259S3xKFLBM) demo is available.
